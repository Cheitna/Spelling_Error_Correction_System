this

one
biggest
challenge
was
figure
encode
this
kind
information
language
proper
way
make
agent
understand
task
is
respond
pan
say
advantage
language
test
this
approach
could
outperform
vision
base
technique
find
that
offer
several
advantage
first
text
require
fewer
computational
resource
synthesize
complex
image
data
method
use
rapidly
generate
synthetic
training
data
one
test
generate
synthetic
trajectory
base
real
world
visual
trajectories
technique
also
bridge
gap
that
prevent
agent
train
simulated
environment
perform
well
real
world
this
gap
often
occur
computer
generate
image
appear
quite
different
real
world
scene
due
element
like
light
color
language
that
describe
synthetic
versus
real
image
would
much
harder
tell
apart
pan
say
also
representation
model
us
are
easier
human
understand
are
write
natural
language
agent
fail
reach
goal
easily
determine
fail
fail
maybe
history
information
is
clear
enough
observation
ignore
important
detail
pan
say
addition
method
could
apply
easily
vary
task
environment
use
one
type
input
long
data
encode
language
use
model
without
make
modification
one
disadvantage
is
that
method
naturally
lose
information
that
would
capture
vision
base
model
depth
information
however
researcher
surprised
see
that
combine
language
base
representation
vision
base
method
improve
agent
ability
navigate
maybe
this
mean
that
language
capture
higher
level
information
cannot
capture
pure
vision
feature
say
this
is
one
area
researcher
want
continue

also
want

that

get
watch
almost
obvious
that
this
groan
is
stand
four
letter

this
was
moment
think
maybe
need
use
audio
video
learn

say
hamilton
is
way
could
let
algorithm
watch

day
this
figure

succeed
this
audio
video
matching

model
learn
people
are
talk
say
hamilton
train
denseav
this
matching

example
someone
say

process
happen
denseav
listen

team
explore
this
give

interestingly
find
one
side
denseav
brain
naturally
focus
language
like
word
dog
side
focus
sound
like

this
show
that
denseav
learn

location
sound
also
learn
distinguish

cross
modal
connection
without
human

knowledge
write

one
branch
application
is
learn
massive
amount
video
publish
internet
day
want
system
that
learn
massive

video
say
hamilton
another
exciting
application
is
understand
new
language
like
dolphin
whale
communication
write
form
communication
hope
is
that
denseav
help
u
understand
language
that
evade
human
translation
effort
since
begin
finally
hope
that
this
method
use
discover
pattern

this
approach
is
inspire

achieve
this
feat
denseav
use
two
main

this
method
call
contrastive
learning
require

example
allow
denseav
figure
important
predictive

one
major
difference
denseav
previous
algorithm
is
that
prior
work
focus
single
notion
similarity
sound
image
entire

clip
like
someone
say
dog
sit
grass
was
match
entire

this
allow
previous
method
discover
fine

dog
team
algorithm
search
aggregate
possible
match

this
improved
performance
allow
team
precisely
localize
sound
way
that
previous
algorithm
could
conventional
method
use
single
class
token
approach
compare
every
pixel
every
second
sound
this
fine
grain
method
let
denseav
make
detailed
connection
better
localization
say
hamilton
researcher
train
denseav
audioset
include
million
youtube

might

ask

could
also

possibly
detect

kornbluth
also

displacement
one
thing
that
annoy

ai
is
stand

this
is

altman
say
also
say

ai
interested
is
scientific

believe
scientific

is
core

that
is
way
drive

kornbluth
also

are
try
this

right

computational

that
are
require
train

this
effort
trained
model
is
relatively
efficient
produce
new

become
require
another
aspect
consider
is
that
operational

route
especially
city
is
constantly
change
available
road
infrastructure
traffic
rule
speed
limit
might
alter
ideal
parking
lot
may

else
construction
site
might

pure

approach
might
actually
trouble
would
basically
resolve
entire
problem
instantly
new
information
problem
become
available
since
operational
environment
is
dynamically
change
would
this
well
trained
model
that
see
similar
issue
could
potentially
suggest
next
best
route
take
almost
instantaneously
tool
that
would
help
company
adjust
increasingly
unpredictable
change
environment
moreover
optimization
algorithm
are
often
manually
craft
solve

give
company
quality

lastly

are
typically

often
seek
minimize

maximize

reality
objective
that
company
driver
face
are
much
complex
that
often
are
also
somewhat
contradictory
instance
company
want
find

also
want
low

driver
also
want
safe
convenient

serve

top
that
company
also
care
consistency
well
design

learn

eventually
capture
high

objective
that
is
something
that
would
never
able
achieve
way
traditional

approach
this
is
kind
machine

that
actually
tangible
real

problem
that
are
much

this

let

around

big

actually
buy
are
many
decision
involve
that
obviously
make
much
harder
task
optimize
single

hope
is
that
this
initial
work
lay
foundation

cage
triangle
calculation
become
messy
make
barycentric

complicated
cage
is
especially
difficult
complex
shape
barycentric

this
construction
help
artist
design
interest
barycentric
coordinate
without

mathematical
aspect
problem
tricky
part
was
build

standard
tool
get
u
way
really
think
outside
box
dodik
say
virtual
triangles
researcher
draw
triangular
barycentric
coordinate
introduce
nearly
year
ago
triangular
coordinate
are
simple
compute
satisfy
necessary
constraint
modern
cage
are
much
complex
triangle
bridge
gap
researcher
method
cover
shape
overlap
virtual
triangle
that
connect
triplet
point
outside
cage
virtual
triangle
define
valid
barycentric
coordinate
function
need
way
combine
say
that
is
neural
network
come
predict
combine
virtual
triangle
barycentric
coordinate
make
complicated
smooth
function
use
method
artist
could
try
one
function
look
final
animation
tweak
coordinate
generate
different
motion
arrive
animation
that
look
way
want
practical
perspective
think
biggest
impact
is
that
neural
network
give
lot
flexibility
that
previously
dodik
say
researcher
demonstrate
method
could
generate
natural
look
animation
approach
like
cat
tail
that
curve
smoothly
move
instead
fold
rigidly
near
vertex
cage
future
want
try
different
strategy
accelerate
neural
network
also
want
build
this
method
interactive
interface
that
would
enable
artist
easily
iterate
